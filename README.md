Task 1: Data Loading
1.1 Load the dataset using pandas.
1.2 Display the first 10 rows.
1.3 Print the shape of the dataset.
1.4 Display column names and data types.
1.5 Check for missing values in each column.

Task 2: Data Cleaning & Validation
2.1 Check for duplicate EmployeeNumber values.
2.2 Remove duplicate records if any exist.
2.3 Identify columns with constant values and remove them (if applicable).
2.4 Ensure numerical columns contain valid ranges (e.g., satisfaction scores 1–4).
2.5 Convert categorical variables to appropriate data types.

Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.1 Compute descriptive statistics for numerical features.
3.2 Analyze attrition distribution (attrition rate).
3.3 Compare attrition by:
    Department
    JobRole
    Gender
3.4 Analyze average income and years at company for attrited vs non-attrited employees.

Task 4: Data Visualization
4.1 Bar chart showing attrition counts.
4.2 Boxplot of MonthlyIncome by attrition status.
4.3 Histogram of employee age.
4.4 Bar chart of attrition rate by department.

Task 5: Feature Engineering
5.1 Create a new feature income_per_year:
      income_per_year = MonthlyIncome × 12
5.2 Create a binary feature long_tenure:
      1 if YearsAtCompany ≥ 5
      0 otherwise
5.3 Create a feature promotion_gap:
        promotion_gap = YearsAtCompany − YearsSinceLastPromotion
5.4 Encode categorical variables using appropriate encoding methods.

Task 6: Correlation & Feature Importance
6.1 Compute correlation matrix for numerical features.
6.2 Visualize correlations using a heatmap.
6.3 Identify features most correlated with attrition.

Task 7: Train–Test Split
7.1 Define the target variable as Attrition.
7.2 Select relevant input features.
7.3 Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20).

Task 8: Classification Modeling
8.1 Train a Logistic Regression classifier.
8.2 Train a Decision Tree or Random Forest classifier.
8.3 Evaluate models using:
      Accuracy
      Precision
      Recall
      F1-score
