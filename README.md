Columns:
order_id – unique order identifier
customer_id – unique customer identifier
country – customer country
product_category – category of purchased product
unit_price – price per unit
quantity – number of units purchased
discount – discount percentage (0–30)
order_date – date of purchase
delivery_days – number of days for delivery


Task 1: Data Loading
1.1.Load the dataset.
1.2.Display the first 10 rows of the dataset.
1.3.Print the shape of the dataset.
1.4.Display column names and data types.
1.5.Check for missing values in each column.

Task 2: Basic Data Cleaning
2.1.Check whether there are duplicate order_id values.
2.2.Remove duplicate records if any exist.
2.3.Ensure that discount values are between 0 and 30.
2.4.Verify that quantity and unit_price are positive.
2.5.Any anomalies you find.(optional)

Task 3: Descriptive Statistics
3.1.Compute mean, median, and standard deviation for unit_price, quantity, and delivery_days.
3.2.Find the minimum and maximum delivery time.
3.3.Group the data by country and calculate the average unit price.
3.4.Group the data by product_category and compute total quantity sold.

Task 4: Data Visualization
4.1.Plot a histogram of unit_price.
4.2.Create a boxplot of delivery_days by country.
4.3.Plot a scatter plot of unit_price vs quantity.
4.4.Create a bar chart showing total sales quantity by product_category.

Task 5: Feature Engineering
5.1.Create a new feature called total_revenue:
total_revenue = unit_price * quantity * (1 - discount / 100)
5.2.Create a feature order_month extracted from order_date.
5.3.Create a binary feature fast_delivery:
    1 if delivery_days ≤ 5
    0 otherwise
5.4.Encode the product_category column using an appropriate encoding method.

Task 6: Correlation Analysis
6.1.Compute the correlation matrix for numerical features.
6.2.Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
6.3.Identify the two features most correlated with total_revenue.

Task 7: Train–Test Split
7.1.Define the target variable as total_revenue.
7.2.Select appropriate input features.
7.3.Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20).

Task 8: Regression Modeling
8.1.Train a Linear Regression model to predict total_revenue.
8.2.Evaluate the model using:
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    R² score

Explain how feature scaling could affect model performance.
